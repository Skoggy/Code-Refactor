Code Refactor assignment

This was our first assignment in the code camp, and I learned quite a lot about how to give a website a more semantic look from the code side of things. It was good to try different ways of adjusting the code, to what I could take out and what had to be left in to try and condense it from the code size, but also to make sure that the user side of it remained the same or better.
 It was interesting learning about how important it is to ensure that your page is accessible to all people, just by adding a few small details to your code. This has an added benefit of making it much easier to read it from the code side for either yourself in the future or someone else that needs to make an adjustment at a later date. 
This seemed to have the desired intention of ensuring that from the beginning we learn how to arrange code and give things good descriptions so as to not get into the bad habit of writing ugly code that while may be fine for a computer to read, would be extremely difficult for any human to read. It is good to get into these habits early, and will make me more employable as no one would want to work with someone who can’t write ugly code.
 Another key thing I made sure to do, so as to make it something I get into the habit of doing, is added comments throughout the code so that it is easier to adjust at a future time.  It is also a very good habit, that when you are using someone else’s code that you should do your best to try and help clean it up, a sort of pay it forward type of thing, because you know that one day someone will do the same for you. This is something that I really enjoy about this industry as it portrays a very good teamwork and working together feeling.


This is a list of the big changes that I made whilst doing this project:

1.Added an id with the name “search-engine-optimization” so that when the link is pressed, the page goes to that part. I am unsure if both ID and Class are actually needed. 
2.Changed the the tag for the header to the actual tag header. More semantic.
3.changed the div tag and id footer, to just a footer tag. 
4.changed the div tag to a nav bar for the nav bar elements.
5.got rid of the individual div h3 css tags, due to the fact they are unnecessary to label them all individually.
6.Made all the aside div tags one tag, and all the corresponding css tags were condensed into one tag.
7.consolidated the H3 tags
8.made footer tag h4 so that I can make a more general tag in css.
9.Gave the images in the aside an alt tag, and consolidated the css tags.
10.changed div tag with the main content to a Main tag.
11.consolidated the class for the main parts on css .
12. Changed the div tags in the main to article tags for semantic look.
13.Added alts to images to make more accessible 
14. changed the font size to a more readable font.
15.Made a more engaging title.
16. Added comments to all of the different sections in the code, so as to make it easier to see what is what.

I know that as this is my first attempt at this that there are probably things I could have done more, or less to make this even better. I know that I will keep learning and will try and do more of these to help hone my skills.
